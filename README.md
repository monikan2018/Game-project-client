### Play Solo Tic-tac-toe
This is a web application the let the player to play tic-tac-toe game solo. In order to play, the player must sign-up and then sign-in to play.  After the player sign-in they can see the number of games they have played so far and can start a new game if unhappy with the current one. The application also allows the player to change password and sign out when they are done.

## Planning
   Understanding the logic and selecting the tools to use to designing and implementing the application were the inital crutial steps I took to designing this application. Lucidchart was used to sketch the frontend of the application and scribled with paper and pen the logic behind this game. I learned bootstrap to design more responive front end designing. Then I used the curl scripts for authoriization and game to design APIs. I understood how javascript and ajax helps in designing this application. After inital phase of understanding the concepts and tools required I started with design phase.
   In the first iteration, I completed the authorization navigation bar and made sure every link works properly.After testing and successfully implementing the authoriation part of the game, in the second iteration, I started coding the interactive design,the board game, logic and then to connect it to authorization part of the game. Then the logic implementation was tested and bugs were fixed. In the final phase, user testing was done to make sure any changes needed can be made before the game is deployed.
   I found developing this application very useful by not only learning and implementing new concepts but also time managment required to complete the project. It took time to debug the issues.
